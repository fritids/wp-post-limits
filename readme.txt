Restrict the number of posts users can make depending on their role

== Description ==

When running wordpress for short term projects, contests, etc. it can be useful to be able
to define a limit on the number of posts a given user can make. This plugin allows admins to
define limits on a per-role basis.

Say you wanted 'authors' to be limited to 5 posts and 'contributors' to just 1, this plugin is
the way to do it.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `wp-post-limits` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Go to the Post Limits option under Settings and make the appropriate entries
